# Performance and editorial SEO rules

Scope: Core Web Vitals, images, fonts, hydration, mobile validation, search intent and on-page content.
Owners: **rendimiento** (budgets/measurement), **vistas** (UI), **contenido** (editorial), **prueba**
(validation).

## Core Web Vitals contract

At the 75th percentile of mobile field data, indexable route groups MUST target:

- LCP ≤ 2.5 s;
- INP ≤ 200 ms;
- CLS ≤ 0.1.

Until representative field data exists, Lighthouse mobile lab checks MUST be used as a diagnostic
proxy and MUST NOT be described as field CWV. The raw bundle budgets in `angular.json` are canonical:
initial 480 KB warning / 520 KB error, lazy 80 KB warning / 120 KB error, component style 8 KB warning /
12 KB error. Older gzipped targets in prose MUST NOT override `angular.json`.

## LCP and images

1. The route’s likely LCP image MUST use `NgOptimizedImage`, `priority`, correct intrinsic `width` and
   `height`, a responsive `sizes`/`srcset`, and a source sized for the viewport.
2. Only the true above-the-fold LCP candidate SHOULD use `priority`; indiscriminate preload competes
   with critical CSS/fonts.
3. Raster delivery MUST follow [performance-optimization](../../performance-optimization/SKILL.md)
   and [asset-organization](../../asset-organization/SKILL.md): WebP baseline, optional AVIF with
   fallback, never runtime `images-src` assets.
4. Share images and content images MUST be crawlable and MUST NOT be blocked by robots or authentication.
5. Lazy loading MUST NOT be applied to the LCP image. Below-fold galleries SHOULD lazy load.

```html
<!-- Compliant -->
<img ngSrc="/assets/images/festivals/medusa/cartel-medusa-2026.webp"
     width="800" height="1000" sizes="(min-width: 1024px) 42vw, 100vw" priority
     alt="Cartel oficial de Medusa Festival 2026">
```

```html
<!-- Non-compliant: layout shift, oversized transfer and vague alt -->
<img src="/assets/images-src/festivals/medusa/source.png" loading="lazy" alt="festival">
```

## CLS, fonts and hydration

- Images, embeds, maps, ads and deferred placeholders MUST reserve stable dimensions/aspect ratio.
- Server and client MUST render the same initial content/order. Locale, date and random selections MUST
  be deterministic across SSR and hydration.
- Self-hosted fonts SHOULD be subset where licensing allows, use `font-display: swap`, and preload only
  the smallest critical face. Fallback metrics SHOULD minimize text reflow.
- Cookie/theme/language UI MUST NOT insert unsized content above the main heading after hydration.
- `@defer` MAY protect the initial bundle, but its placeholder MUST reserve final space and the deferred
  content MUST not contain the only indexable facts or links.

## INP and JavaScript

- Filters and search SHOULD update in under 200 ms without long main-thread tasks.
- Expensive map, playlist, gallery and search code MUST stay out of the initial route chunk when not
  required above the fold.
- Event handlers MUST NOT synchronously rebuild the entire festival catalogue; computation SHOULD use
  pure signals/selectors and be measured on a mid-tier mobile profile.
- Third-party scripts MUST require a documented user and business purpose, load after critical content,
  and be removed if their cost is disproportionate.
- Hydration errors, duplicate data fetching and event replay regressions MUST fail release validation.

## Mobile-first validation

Every SEO-facing template change MUST be tested at 320, 375, 768, 1024 and 1440 CSS px as required by
the design validation standard. At 320 px, primary heading, date/place facts and canonical navigation
MUST be readable without horizontal scrolling. Mobile HTML/content MUST remain equivalent to desktop;
mobile MUST NOT hide essential facts for ranking or users.

## Editorial search intent

Before creating or materially rewriting an indexable page, **contenido + rendimiento** MUST record:

1. primary user task (discover, compare, plan, verify line-up, find official ticket link);
2. entity and geography served;
3. why the page is distinct from existing routes;
4. official sources and verification date;
5. intended internal links and update trigger.

Keyword research MAY inform wording, but copy MUST answer the task naturally. A keyword density target,
synonym lists inserted for ranking, invisible text and repetitive place-name blocks MUST NOT be used.

Compliant intent: `/calendario` helps users compare confirmed dates and conflicts by day.
Non-compliant intent: create twenty near-identical “mejores festivales baratos en [town]” pages that
all point to `/festivales`.

## Headings and page content

- Each route MUST have one descriptive visible `<h1>` aligned with the title but not required to match
  character-for-character.
- Heading levels MUST form a semantic outline and MUST NOT be chosen for styling. See
  [accessibility](../../accessibility/SKILL.md).
- Festival detail SHOULD organize verified dates/location, line-up, price/tickets, venue/travel and
  official links under useful `<h2>` sections.
- Important text MUST be HTML text, not only embedded in a poster image, map or iframe.
- Boilerplate MUST NOT dominate unique route content.

## Editorial quality and links

1. Copy MUST be original, concise, grammatically correct Spanish and transparent about uncertainty.
2. Critical mutable facts MUST be cross-checked with an official source immediately before publication.
3. External links MUST resolve to the relevant official page; generic home links SHOULD NOT replace a
   known ticket/event page.
4. Internal links MUST support the user journey and use descriptive anchor text.
5. `dateModified` MUST represent a material reviewed update; auto-touching dates is forbidden.
6. Outdated information MUST be corrected, explicitly archived or removed under the status rules; it
   MUST NOT remain live because it attracts traffic.

## Alt text

- Informative images MUST have concise context-specific alt text in the active locale.
- A festival poster alt SHOULD identify official poster + festival + edition when visible and verified.
- Decorative atmospheric images MUST use `alt=""`.
- Alt text MUST not start with “imagen de”, repeat nearby captions unnecessarily or list SEO keywords.
- Text contained only in a poster that is essential to the page MUST also be present as accessible HTML.

MVP: all rules above apply to live routes. Roadmap additions (third-party scripts, richer galleries,
localized assets) inherit the same budgets and require new measurements, not exemptions.
